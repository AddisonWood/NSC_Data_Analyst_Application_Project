# NSC_Data_Analyst_Application_Project

## Welcome to my application project for the Data Analyst position at Nashville SC!
### Save for the data sources, which are in the main repository, the reports and code for both exercises are in their own individual folders, `Exercise_1/` and `Exercise_2`.
#### For exercise 1, the code for the Orlando Cty @ Nashville SC (11/23/21) post-match report is in it's own Jupyter notebook: `NSH_ORL_Report.ipynb`
#### The code for both the opposition report and set-piece report are together in their own Jupyter notebook: `PHI_NSH_20211128_PreMatch_Report.ipynb`

## Sources
### For this project I mainly pulled data from FBRef.com, utilizing their StatsBomb-powered box scores.
### I also used the heat maps from WhoScored.com as a proxy for some event data x-y analysis, and the xG timelines at MLSSoccer.com as a way to get xG per shot without access to event data.
### I used the Goals Added interactive tables at AmericanSoccerAnalysis.com for one point in the Orlando post-match report.
### I referenced Transfermarkt.com and SpotRac.com for injury and transfer/loan historical data to provide more context in the player scouting exercise.
